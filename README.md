# libptools
libptools / ptools is a library of helpful programme tools written in Assembly.

# About
I currently have the following functions in ptools:
* Clear screen
* Display entry/exit banner
  <br>
  <br>
I will likely be working on adding more.

# Help
The src/ directory contains example code of each library function. These can be ran on their own, but are not ready for use in the ptools library. There is also a basic example c programme that acts as a runner to test each ptool function.

The lib/ directory contains the library ready code of each function.

You can download the compiled library in releases.

# Disclaimer
This is more of an educational project for myself, please do not expect this library to be actually useful/practical or production ready in any way.
